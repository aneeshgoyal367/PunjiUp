    <h1>CLOSED END FUNDS</h1>
    <p>A close-ended fund is a kind of mutual fund that pools resources from numerous investors through issuance of New Fund Offer (NFO). An investor buys units of the fund during the NFO period. The units are sold at a price based on Net Asset Value of the mutual fund that is launching the NFO.

        Close-ended fund raise a fixed amount of capital through NFOs. After that no fresh unit can be bought from the fund house but the issued units can be traded on listed stock exchanges.
    After an asset management company launches New Fund Offer (NFO), an investor buys units of the fund at a specific price. No new investor can enter the fund after the NFO period is over. Also, investors are not allowed to exit the fund before the maturity of the scheme.  The maturity period typically ranges from 3-4 years.

            Investors who want to exit the fund before maturity, can trade their units on stock exchanges. Closed end fundsâ€™ units are traded on stock exchanges just like any other public security. The price of the units vary according to market fluctuations and performance of the concerned investment portfolio of the scheme.
            
            Sometimes close-ended funds trade at a discounted price on their Net Asset Value (NAV). New investors can capitalize on this difference to earn decent returns in the future, as redemptions on maturity happens at NAV.</p>
