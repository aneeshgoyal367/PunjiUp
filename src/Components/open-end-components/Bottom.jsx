<h1>OPEN END FUNDS</h1>
    <p>An open ended fund is a fund which is officially launched after the NFO ends. It allows investors to enter and exit the fund anytime after they are launched. 
        Open-ended funds are suitable for investors who wish to invest in a liquid investment instrument and are willing to undertake market risk and cash flow risk for high returns.
        Open-ended funds provide high liquidity as they allow investors to redeem the fund units at any time they want. The fund units are redeemed at the fundâ€™s net asset value (NAV) of the day on which units are redeemed.
             Unlike close-ended funds, the performance track record of an open-ended fund spanning across different market cycles is available. This allows investors to take a well-informed decision.
             Open-ended funds allow investors to make use of systematic plans both for the investment and withdrawal purposes. An investor cannot make use of SIPs, SWPs and STPs with close-ended funds.</p>
